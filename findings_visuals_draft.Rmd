# Demographics 

## Population of Children and Families

The Antelope Valley is a 2,200 square mile area in northern Los Angeles County [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antelope_Valley). According to the US Census, it's two largest cities, Lancaster and Palmdale, have populations of 170,150 and 165,761, respectively.[1](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/palmdalecitycalifornia,lancastercitycalifornia/PST045221). For comparison, both cities are more populous than Pasadena and Pomona, two well-known mid-size cities on the other side of the valley.

**The Antelope Valley Best Start Region 5 is home to a population of 368,522 people [1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/luz3725/viz/2020CensusData-AVBESTSTARTREGION5/GRAPI)**. According to Catalyst California calculations of 2020 American Community Survey estimates, **the Lancaster and Palmdale Best Start geographies hold roughly 25,000 children**, with 12,821 and 13,068 children ages 0 to 5, respectively. These 25,000+ children represent more than 7% of the Lancaster and Palmdale Best Start geography populations.


## Racial Ethnic Breakdown 

According to the latest American Community Survey data calculated by Lucy Wilkerson, **Region 5 is majority Latinx and the regional share of the Black population is twice the LA County share and nearly three times the State share**. On the other hand, the region is home to relatively fewer Asian residents than the County and State as a whole.

## Black Infant Mortality 

According to the California Department of Public Health, Los Angeles County 20015-17 Black infant mortality rates are more than twice the rate of infant mortality overall (9.3 vs. 4.2 infant deaths per 1,000 live births). Not available by race, but First 5 LA reports 2011-16 Children's Data Network infant mortality rates for the total populations of the Lancaster and Palmdale Best Start geographies at 6.0 and 5.7 per 1,000, respectively.[1](https://www.first5la.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/First-5-LA-2020-Indicators-Report.pdf)

**The County's Black infant mortality rate is twice the infant mortality rate overall: 9.3 Black LA County infant deaths per 1,000 live births compared to total rate of 4.2 per 1,000**[1](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/infant-mortality-deaths-per-1000-live-births-lghc-indicator-01/resource/ae78da8f-1661-45f6-b2d0-1014857d16e3)

Recent data are a challenge as this data, from the California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal is from 2015-2017. The [African American Infant and Maternal Mortality (AAIMM) Initiative](https://www.blackinfantsandfamilies.org/) is a coalition working to address the unacceptably high rates of Black infant and maternal deaths in the County. [A Pathway to Equity](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/centerforhealthequity/PDF/AAIM-ActionPlan.pdf) is a framework for understanding the causes of infant mortality and the steps needed to address it.

## Children of Incarcerated

According to Catalyst California calculations of Vera Institute for Justice, County of Los Angeles Probation, and the Bureau of Justice Statistics, there are an estimated **90,000 children in Los Angeles County with a parent in State Prison, LA County Jail, or under LA County probation and 17,000 of these children are ages 0 to 5**. This means that roughly 1 in 20 LA County children have an incarcerated parent or parent under probation. Roughly 20,000 of these children are Black with 4,000 of them between the age 0 to 5.

Because the criminal justice system over criminalizes Black and Brown parents, children of incarcerated parents or parents under probation are more likely to be Latino or Black than their share of the total population. **Black children make up 22% of Los Angeles County children with an incarcerated parent or parent under probation but are only 7.5% of the total population**. By contrast, White children make up 11.6% of county children with an incarcerated parent or parent under probation but are 20.4% of the total population.

```{r}

Race <- c("Percent children of incarcerated or probation parent", "Percent of County children", "Difference")
Black <- c("22.0%",	"7.5%",	"14.5%")
Latino <- c("63.0%",	"55.7%",	"7.3%")

Total <- c("100%",	"100%",	"0%")

This matters because separation or probation impacts the ability of parents to live with, supervise, and be attentive to their children. They are not as able to help with homework, know who their kids’ friends are, have a sense of how school is going, and what their children are eating, for example. Each of these things impact a child’s ability to succeed in school, be healthy, and otherwise thrive.

## Foster Youth Population 

Overall in the Antelope Valley (AV) during the 2021-2022 school year, 2,008 students (or 2.3%) are in the Foster Care System. Black (5.2%) and American Indian / Alaskan Native (5.3%) students are over 10 times more likely to be in the foster care system than Asian (0.5%) students, the group least likely to be in the foster care system in the AV. Native Hawaiian / Pacific Islander (4.2%) students also have a high rate of students in foster care compared to the AV average, almost 2 times more in fact. At the district level, the Eastside Union Elementary School District has almost double the percentage of students in foster care compared to the AV average and over 7 times more compared to the School District with the lowest percentage.

## Student Migrant Population

Overall, 281 students (0.3% or 0.3 out of 100 students) are in the California's Migrant Education Program in the Antelope Valley. This count is likely an undercount since this number represents only the students who are registered through the Migrant Education Program. Palmdale Elementary School District has a 2.7 times greater percentage of migratory students than the AV average. 

<!-- That is because of American Indian Alaskan Native students in the Palmdale elementary school district has 3.2 times more migratory student than even the next largest group of migratory students, Latinx students. At the region level as well, American Indian Alaskan Native students has the greatest percentage of migratory students. -->

### Non-binary
The CDE started tracking students who identify as non-binary gender in the 2020-21 School Year. At that time, 23 students in the Antelope Valley identified as non-binary. Now in the 2021-22 School Year, that number has increased to 51 students (0.1% or 0.1 students out of 100) of the total AV student population. By percent, AIAN students had the highest rate of students who identified (0.6%) while in raw count Latinx students had the most students (26 students).

The Acton-Agua Dulce School District has the largest percentage of students who identify as non-binary during the 2020-21 school year. 44 out of the 51 students who identify as non-binary were in the Acton-Agua School District. 

Non-binary gender is tracked via students or school staff such as teachers electing to change the student's gender categorization on their Statewide Student Identifier (SSID). Because of the need for students to change their gender on their SSIDs to be counted as non-binary, this indicator likely undercounts non-binary students.

## Socioeconomically Disadvantaged

The CDE has a category called Socioeconomically disadvantaged that it defines with the following criteria: 
  * student is eligible or participating in the Free or Reduce Meal program, Migrant program, or Foster program
  * the student's parents do not have a high school diploma
  * the student was Homeless, Directly Certified, a Tribal Foster Youth, or enrolled in a Juvenile Court School

In further definition, Direct Certification, means that the student was eligible for the Free Meal program without having to apply for it separately. That is usually because the student is already registered for other social or welfare services such as CalFresh or CalWORKs.(cde.ca.gov)

In the 2021-22 school year, an extremely high percentage, 75% of students (or 3 in every 4 students), were categorized as socioeconomically disadvantaged. In particular Black (84%), American Indian Alaskan Native (82%), and Latinx (80%) students had the highest rates in the Antelope Valley. In the the racial and ethnic groups with the lowest rates in the AV, still around half of students were considered socioeconomically disadvantaged. These high rates were specially pervasive in the Wilsona Elementary School District where 97%, almost all students where considered socioeconomically disadvantaged. In that district, Black and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander students had the highest rates (approx. 100% for both), closely followed by Latinx students (98%).

## Student Homelessness

According to the California Department Of Education 2021_22 school year data, Student Homelessness on average in the Antelope Valley, 2.2% (or 2.2 out of 100), is slightly lower than the the state average, 2.9%, and Los Angeles County average, 2.8%. However, school district level data tells a different story.

Student Homelessness is especially high in the Westside Union Elementary School District with an average rate of 7.2%, over 3 times the average of the entire Antelope Valley, 2.1%. That means that approx. 7 out of every 100 students in the Westside Union Elementary School District is experiencing homelessness. Although there are high rates among all groups in the the Westside Union Elementary School District, the high rates of homelessness among Non-Hispanic American Indian Alaskan Native (AIAN) students (14.3%), Non-Hispanic Black students (7.6%), Latinx students (8.2%), and students who identified as Non-Hispanic Two or More Races (8.1%) especially stand out. 

The Hughes-Elizabeth Lakes Union Elementary School District and the Wilsona Elementary School District had the next highest rates, both being 2.3 times higher than the state average. For the Hughes-Elizabeth Lakes Union Elementary School District, the high rates for Latinx students were the highest (5.7%). In the case of the Wilsona Elementary School District, the high rates for Black (11.5%), Latinx (6.6%), and White students (6.2%) especially drove up the average.

The Eastside Union Elementary School District and Lancaster Elementary School District also had above average rates, being 2 and 1.2 times higher than the state average respectively. Regionally, students who identified as Non-Hispanic Two or More Races and Non-Hispanic Black and Non-Hispanic AIAN students had the highest rates. 

The bulk of the students experiencing homelessness in the Antelope Valley are in grades 1-8. Notably, student homelessness rates range between 15 to 20% of students. Second-grade students had the highest rates with 2 out of 10 experiencing homelessness. 

Given this information, interventions targeting current elementary and middle school students,  and Black, Latinx, AIAN, and Two or More Race students are pressing.

## Homelessness

The 2022 Los Angeles County homeless count counted over 65,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County, 1,000 of whom lived in the cities of Lancaster and Palmdale.Thousands more homeless residents live just outside city boundaries in the Antelope Valley (SPA 1). **LAHSA counted 4,598 Antelope Valley homeless persons in 2022 including 3,570 unsheltered and 1,028 sheltered persons.** Another way to break that 4,500+ homeless population shows that figure is made up of 3,681 individuals, 910 family members, and 7 unaccompanied minors.A [Vice News Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzbU-9L1WS4) details that law enforcement contributes to moving homeless persons outside of city boundaries and into the broader region.

## Students with Disabilities 

Overall in the Antelope Valley, 15% of students have disabilities in the 2021-22 school year, 2.5 percentage points higher than the state average.[2](https://lao.ca.gov/reports/2019/4110/overview-spec-ed-110619.pdf) The percentage of students with disabilities in the Antelope Valley has steadily increased by 2.7 percentage points since the 2015-16 school year. In particular, the Acton-Agua Dulce Unified and Antelope Valley Union High School Districts have above AV average rates of students with disabilities, 16.5% and 17.2% respectively. Given the extremely large number of students with disabilities, the Antelope Valley has an urgent priority need for additional resources for students with disabilities. 

<!-- 
The grades with the highest percentage of students with disabilities were 6th grade (73.5%), 8th grade (71.8%), and 7th grade (73.5%). At the school district level, the Antelope Valley Union Joint High School District has the highest, 17.2% and Eastside Elementary School District has the lowest, 12.5%.  Students in the 4th and 5th grades also had a larger percentage of students with disabilities. Despite the high reported numbers of students with disabilities, the actual numbers are likely higher. Younger students with disabilities tend to be underrepresented because students are assessed for disabilities on an as-needed basis, therefore, it takes time for students to be assessed and as more time passes, more students are assessed thereby increasing the reported number of students with disabilities.  
-->
<!-- 
American Indian Alaskan Native (AIAN) students had the highest percentage of students with disabilities by race/ethnicity with 21.3% of AIAN students having disabilities. Black (20.8%), Two or More Races (16.7%) and White students (15.6%) all had above Antelope Valley average rates as well.

## Languages of Children and Families

According to the latest American Community Survey data calculated by Lucy Wilkerson, the Antelope Valley has a diverse set of language speakers. The East Antelope Valley and Palmdale areas have a larger shares of Spanish speakers than the County or State as a whole. There are relatively fewer speakers of Asian or Pacific Islander languages, with West Antelope Valley having the largest share of this group.

## English Language Learners

In the Antelope Valley 14% of students were considered English Language Learners. Latinx students has the highest rate by race / ethnicity (20.4%) closely followed by Asian students (19.9%). The Wilsona followed by the Keppel School Districts had the highest rates by school district, 32.5% and 29.3% respectively. In the Wilsona School District 40% of Latinx and 30% of AIAN students were considered English Language Learners. The high percentages for Latinx students had an especially high impact on the ELL rates because Latinx students make up a large share of the AV student population.

# Resources (and barriers to access)
Antelope Valley stakeholders have been clear about the need for additional resources, including health and mental health services, early childhood education, and parks and recreation. According to the [Los Angeles County Health Survey](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/ha/hasurveyintro.htm), **16.4% of Antelope Valley children report difficulty accessing medical care (highest among county Service Planning Areas or SPAs)**. Medical care can be especially important for chronic conditions that need periodic medical care such as asthma. 18.8% of Antelope Valley children have been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives (highest among LA SPAs), meaning access to health care is especially important for the Antelope Valley population.

## Early Childhood Education
According to estimates from the [American Institutes of Research](https://elneedsassessment.org/), **no Antelope Valley ZIP code had an unmet need for infant/toddler care rate below 93.55% of eligible children in 2020**. Preschool accessibility was hardly better, with no Antelope Valley ZIP code having an unmet need for preschool rate below 64.23%. These high rates of unmet need for early care and education mean it is difficult for parents to find care for their children and may need to reduce working hours to care for them. 40.9% of Antelope Valley parents report difficulty finding childcare (highest among county SPAs).[1](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/ha/hasurveyintro.htm)

## Parks
The Los Angeles County County Department of Parks and Recreation completed a Countywide Parks and Recreation Needs Assessment addition in 2022. The assessment has findings for the region in an [Antelope Valley regional profile](https://lacountyparkneeds.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AppA_RegionalProfiles_AntelopeValley_11282022.pdf). Some key findings from that profile:

* The regional recreation facilities and trails in the area are poorly served by public transportation and largely inaccessible without the use of a personal vehicle.
* The highest Regional Recreation Need is found in Lake Los Angeles, Littlerock, and Sun Village due to a combination of social and environmental factors.
* Community members identified heat, distance, safety, lack of information and limited facilities as barriers to park use for residents in the study area.
* **Residents say they need more shade, cooling centers and access to water, affordable transit access to parks, additional facilities and programming, enhanced safety measures and more information about parks and amenities**.

# Economics 

## Rent Burden (Cost Burden Renter)


East Antelope Valley had the highest rates of its population being rent burdened, meaning that they were spending over 30% of their income on rent, 62.3%.

## Evictions

To calculate evictions, 2013-2017 data was used due to the limitations of available data. There have been 636 evictions in the AV between 2013-2017. Meaning 1 out of 50 people in the AV faced evictions during this time period. By rate, Lake Los Angeles had the most evictions while Quartz Hill had the least. The neighborhoods of Lancaster (350 evictions) and Palmdale (226 evictions) had the most evictions by count. About half of all evictions during this time period were in Lancaster.

Source: [Eviction Lab with ACS 2013-2017, 2020](https://data-downloads.evictionlab.org/#data-for-analysis/)

Asian, White, and Latinx residents had the highest rate of most evictions in the Lake Los Angeles Neighborhood by per 100 people. In Lancaster, Black, Latinx, NHPI and residents who identified as Non-Hispanic Two or More Races all faced evictions at a rate at or above the AV overall total. The same was true in Palmdale, the neighborhood with the second highest population in which Black and residents who identified as Non-Hispanic Two or More Races. In Quartz Hill, residents who identified as Non-Hispanic Other Races had the highest rate of evictions which shows the need to further investigate and disaggregate who might identify as Non-Hispanic Other in the area.

## Cost of Living

According to the United Ways of California, **roughly half of households in and around Lancaster and Palmdale do not earn sufficient incomes to meet their basic costs of living** (i.e., they earn incomes below the real cost measure of living). Lancaster and Palmdale adjusted median household incomes are well below other parts of the County and State.

## Food Insecurity 

Feeding America estimates that 55,110 children are food insecure in Congressional District 25, covering Antelope Valley outside of Lancaster[1](https://map.feedingamerica.org/district/2020/overall/california/district/25). **Over 10,000 Antelope Valley children under 5  participate in WIC**. Latinx children comprise the largest share of Antelope Valley WIC participants, with nearly 1 in 5 Palmdale participants living in a Spanish-only home. Black children make up nearly 1 in 4 Lancaster WIC participants.

# Education

## Highschool Graduation

The average high school graduation rate in the Antelope Valley is 65%. In the AV, Latinx (63.6%) followed by Black (64.8%) students had the lowest graduation rates while Filipino (82.7%) and Asian (80.7%) students had the highest. The Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District has the lowest graduation rate (34.7%). Notably in the Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District Latinx, Black, Filipino, and students who identified as non-Hispanic Two or More Races all had under 50% graduation rates. The Gorman Joint School District had the highest rate (81.9%). 

The Antelope Valley Union High School District had a total rate of 80.3%, comparable to the LA County average. Similar to county trends, Black students had the lowest graduation rates (73.1%) followed by students who identified as Two or More Races (80.9%) and Latinx students (81.5%). Filipino (93.8%) followed by Asian (88.6%) and White (81.9%) students have the highest rates.

## Teacher & Staff Diversity 

The most recent California Department of Education data on certificated staff is from the 2018-19 school year. It shows that **the majority of AV school district students are Latinx but see relatively few Latinx teachers**. In that year White students made up 13.4% of enrolled students and White staff made up 69.4% of certificated staff. By contrast Latinx students made up 63.2% of enrolled students and Latinx staff made up 17.9% of certificated staff

## Chronic Absenteeism
**More than 1 in 6 Antelope Valley students (17.5%) were chronically absent in the 2018-19 school year**, the last year we have a complete year's data from the California Department of Education. Black students were most likely to be chronically absent in Antelope Valley schools with 27.5% of eligible Black Antelope Valley students absent for 10% or more of the days they were expected to attend.

Chronic absenteeism stems for a variety of factors including student-specific, family-specific, school-specific, and community-specific factors, which vary by age. For example, schools that do not engage children and families with work schedules making it difficult to monitor their children's schooling, are two contributors to absenteeism.[1](https://www.brookings.edu/research/chronic-absenteeism-an-old-problem-in-search-of-new-answers/).

## Suspensions
The last full year of in-class learning for which the California Department of Education publishes data is 2021-22. That year **suspension rates for Foster and Black students were more than double the district total suspension rate Antelope Valley school districts**. American Indian or Alaska Native and Multiracial suspension rates were also often above totals in most area school districts.

## 3rd Grade Math Scores

In the 2021-22 School Year in the Antelope Valley, 24% of Students in the 3rd Grade scored Proficient or Better in Math. That means that about 1 in 5 3rd grade students in the AV had sufficient Math scores. Black students in the AV had the lowest scores with about 1 in 10 scoring proficient or better in Math while Asian students had the highest rate of students scoring proficient or better at a rate of 54%. 24% of Latinx students, the most populous group int he AV, scored proficient in Math, which is also likely why the AV average score was also at 24%, because of the heavy influence of the low scores for the greatest populations of students. At the school district level, the Eastside  Union Elementary School District had the lowest scores with only 16% of 3rd grade students scoring proficient or better while the Acton-Agua Unified School District had the highest at 40%. None of the school districts scored above 40% while most of them scored around 20%. This means that across the board, math scores were fairly low for 3rd grade students in the AV.

## 3rd Grade English Scores

Only about 1 in 4 3rd grade students int he AV scored proficient or better in English Language Arts. The overall score was 25% of students passing, which was 12 percentage points lower than the The Los Angeles County average, 37%. Black (13%) followed by Latinx (25%) students had the lowest rates while Asian and Filipino 3rd grade students had the highest rates, with both scoring a little less than half. At the school district level Wilsona Elementary followed by Lancaster Elementary had the lowest average rates, 14% and 20% respectively. Lancaster Elementary and Palmdale Elementary School Districts had especially low rates for Black 3rd grade students, 12% for both. Wilsona had an especially low rate for Latinx students about 14%.

# Safety and Justice 

## Police Violence
In Antelope Valley ZIP codes, law enforcement visits the most violence on Black residents per 100,000 people.

## Traffic Stops
Black and NHPI populations are significantly more likely to be stopped by the Sheriff's Police Department than the race groups. 
For example, Blacks are 2.4 times more likely to be stopped than Whites and NHPIs are 2.5 times more likely to be stopped than Whites. While there is not a data set available that can be clipped for the just the Antelope Valley region, we do see that within the police jurisdiction that covers this region, there is a racial discrepancy in stop rates.
