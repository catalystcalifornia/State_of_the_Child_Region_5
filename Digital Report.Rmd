#Executive Summary 

This report presents the results of the most comprehensive set of Antelope Valley data on the impacts of public systems on children. The Children’s Bureau commissioned it to understand the state of children in the Antelope Valley, identify indicators to monitor, and increase the amount of data available to advocates. We hope that county agencies, funders, and other partners use this report to learn more about the Antelope Valley and engage with Antelope Valley communities in their work. Catalyst California partnered with the Children’s Bureau to ask over 100 residents and advocates for recommendations on what issues to consider, positive examples to uplift, and data to include in the report. Their recommendations shape the content gathered for this report and were reviewed and approved by a steering committee of 20 community experts. The results show that: 

The family-friendly, low-cost-of-living Antelope Valley that residents love is disappearing, and a new more proactive infrastructure for children and families is needed. The current infrastructure is not set up for the population increases the Antelope Valley has seen in the last decade, and this lack of resources drives school-to-prison, and youth-to-houselessness pipelines and other avoidable outcomes. To be specific: 

The Antelope Valley has a large, diverse, and growing population with roughly 120,000 children under age 18 and 30,000 children ages 0 to 5, including many children needing extra support. 

Half of households in and around Lancaster and Palmdale can't cover basic costs like housing, food, transportation, and child care with their incomes, and four-in-five families with children under age six earn less than the real cost of living. 

High housing costs make these relatively lower wages particularly harmful and contribute to a growing unhoused population in the region. 

Antelope Valley resources are not keeping up with the needs of residents. Residents struggle to access health and mental health services and find few child care and learning opportunities for their children. 

Equitable treatment of local children and families is a concern. Rates of hate crimes exceed those countywide, and law enforcement stops Black drivers more and injures Black civilians more than people of other races. 

Student outcomes in Antelope Valley schools are lower than those countywide. School staff are not representative of the diversity of the student body. Foster students and students with disabilities – students who might need the most support – are most likely to be suspended in. 

To address these ongoing issues, increased investments in health and mental health are needed, as are increases in child care reimbursement rates and other forms of investments in Antelope Valley education. Strengthening the safety net of programs that provide resources or training to residents is a must. Individuals can collaborate to hold systems accountable and spread awareness of resources as well. 

The Children’s Bureau, as facilitator of First 5 LA’s Best Start regional network in the Antelope Valley, will coordinate activities to support this new infrastructure, including hosting regular forums for family-focused organizations, and updating and implementing a community change agenda. We present the results of our data compilation to inform this effort and for the consideration of local funders, policymakers, and advocates. 

#Introduction 

The Antelope Valley is vast, requiring one to drive roughly two hours to cross it from west to east;[^1] populous, with an estimated 431,767 people; and growing, increasing in population by 9.1% between 2011 and 2021 while LA County grew by only 2.3%.[^2] The region’s two largest cities, Lancaster and Palmdale are more populous than Pasadena and Pomona, perhaps more well-known cities on the other side of the valley.3 The region also includes large unincorporated communities, and expansive areas of sparsely or uninhabited desert. It is in some ways an escape from the packed, traffic-filled hubbub of Downtown Los Angeles. Because of its location in the desert, it can reach sweltering high heats above 110°F in the summer and extreme cold of 20°F in the winter. 

>*"A lot of times you hear about the AV, you think hot and desert, so I was worried. As a parent, one thing I love to do with my kids is being outdoors and feeling safe doing it. "  *

The community members interviewed for this report who live and work in the Antelope Valley describe the region largely in two tenses (past and present) or in comparison to the City of Los Angeles. In the past, they say the Antelope Valley was full of kind and welcoming places with a small-town feel, where you knew your neighbors and had a sense of community. People could get by with less and it was a great place to grow up or raise children because people there cared about you and looked out for you.  

>*"I raised three children in the AV, I enjoyed most of the ability to not be packed in a tight neighborhood. We lived in the rural area in the AV, there’s a lot of nature and bringing up my kids in the middle of nowhere gave me control over who they were spending time with." * 
>
>- Antelope Valley Parent 

In the present, those we’ve spoken to focus almost entirely on recent challenges: a declining education system, the opioid epidemic, unaffordability of housing and rising houselessness, a lack of resources for the fast-growing population, and crime. They say families need to work more hours or travel further to make ends meet today, reducing quality time with their children. They see a striking difference between the Antelope Valley they knew and what they see today. 

Community members still favor the Antelope Valley when comparing it to the City of LA, however. They speak about the slower pace. As a community member put it, “Antelope Valley is a diverse community that provides a slower, more peaceful living pace than other parts of LA County or neighboring counties like Orange County.” That spirit of togetherness and what’s possible permeates, which is why all of them work to make their communities better and believe in the power of their advocacy and that of others to improve the state of children and their families. 

#Methodology 

To inform these advocates, local policymakers, and funders we wanted to understand the state of children in Antelope Valley – as directed by residents and advocates of the Antelope Valley - and provide indicators to track and increase data-driven research for advocacy efforts. We wanted to not only understand systems directly impacting children, such as child care and child welfare, but systems impacting their families as well, like housing and law enforcement. Too often descriptions of what children need leave out the “whole child” and overlook their families and communities. This is especially critical when systems impact families inequitably, in other words, when most families are unaffected by a system, but a minority are severely affected. When focusing on what makes children thrive, it is precisely this “whole child” equity approach that is necessary.  

This report addresses this challenge by reporting data that residents want to see and might not be traditionally considered in early care and education research. This means a relatively greater emphasis here on data about specific Antelope Valley issues (e.g., discrimination in health care access) and populations (foster youth and youth with disabilities) and a relatively lesser emphasis on broader topics found in community health needs assessments and profiles generally. It also includes data collected by Antelope Valley advocates such as Luz Wilkerson who has published a dashboard of her many findings.[^4] 

To ensure the most robust data possible, we set out to create this report with Antelope Valley residents and advocates. In September 2022, we asked over 100 residents and advocates in the Best Start network what data they wanted to describe the state of children in the Antelope Valley. Across three network meetings in multiple break out groups (in English and Spanish), residents and advocates recommended what they wanted to see. In December 2022, we reported back a summary of what they asked for, and they told us what resonated and what was still missing. These residents and advocates concluded that to understand the state of the child, they wanted to see Antelope Valley-specific data about: 

Demographics of the diverse children and families of the Antelope Valley, especially populations with specific needs like foster youth, unhoused youth, and students with disabilities 

 1. How our education system, including our early education system supports these children and families 

 2. The economics, especially the cost of living that impacts budgets of these children and families 

 3. How the increasing unaffordability of housing and houselessness affect children and families 

 4. How equitable or unequitable are outcomes from key systems, such as law enforcement 

 5. And finally, how the lack of resources constricts choices children and families have. 

That community update of our summary essentially forms the sections and sub-sections of this report. Catalyst California gathered the recommended data and shared it with a subset or steering committee of these residents and advocates for approval in March 2023. This group reviewed and approved the final report in May 2023. 

While this certainly was not a perfect process, we believe the effort to engage residents and advocates has been worthwhile. No other report to our knowledge includes this amount of Antelope Valley-specific data on systemic impacts on children and families. It is vital, for the children of Antelope Valley, that these data-driven findings be used to improve and build more equitable systems. 

All data in this report and much more are available in the public GitHub repository here [LINK]. Data are available for different geographies and by different geographic units. At times, SPA 1 is used to denote the Antelope Valley. Other times, smaller geographic units – for example Census tracts, ZIP codes, and school districts - are aggregated to estimate Antelope Valley. Pay close attention to the geographies used in charts and tables and see the GitHub repository for geographic definition tables. 

This report is limited by many factors including the following: 

- There is less data available about the Antelope Valley, given smaller and more rural populations than other parts of the county. Unincorporated, and other areas served by county agencies can lack the specificity of data captured by more local, e.g., city agencies. 

- There is less data available for subgroups of the population, for example racial-ethnic groups, particularly when subgroups have relatively small populations. 

- We were unable to survey representative samples of the population to contribute to findings and make do with input from a smaller number of interviews of a larger number of focus group participants. 

This report is meant to serve as a foundation for a growing conversation on the infrastructure and systems needed to improve the overall health and well-being of children in the Antelope Valley region. We recognize that it is not inclusive of every facet that impacts a child and encourage future researchers to build upon the data this report provides. In the community-sensemaking sessions held, two future research exploration ideas arose. 

1. A resource and needs assessment map. Many community members expressed concern that the facilities providing support for children via extracurricular activities, basic needs services, or educational opportunities fall short of the demand for those services or are inaccessible. A map could show organizations where to focus their efforts or where additional services are needed.  

2. Youth engagement and participation. Additional engagement with young people on their experiences in the region and what they need to thrive will be key to improving the well-being of children in the Antelope Valley. Developing ways for youth to hold a greater role shaping their systems will make them more successful.

#Findings 

##The Antelope Valley is populous and diverse with many children, including children needing extra support  

The Antelope Valley is home to a population of 431,767, with 120,525 children under age 18 and 29,666 children under age 5.5 The majority of Antelope Valley children are Latinx, and relatively more Black children and relatively fewer Asian children live in the Antelope Valley than LA County as a whole. Roughly one third of Antelope Valley residents speak Spanish at home, 3.8% speak an Asian, Pacific Islander, or Indo-European language, and the remainder speak English.[^6] 

 

 

The majority of Antelope Valley children attend schools in Antelope Valley school districts. The California Department of Education publishes information about student subgroups that is helpful in understanding the state of children, namely the numbers of students in foster care, students experiencing houselessness, and students with disabilities. Nearly 2,000 students in the Antelope Valley schools are unhoused, about 2.2% of the student population.[^7] Just over 2,000 students are in foster care in the region (2.3% of the student population).[^8] There are 13,279 students with disabilities attending Antelope Valley schools (15% of the student population).[^9] 

 

>COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT: The Nehemiah Project is addressing one of the biggest gaps in the foster care system which is support for youth that leave foster care after turning 18. The organization on the ground provides transitional housing, employment opportunity training, referral services, and connects youth with vital resources. The Nehemiah Project is also led by and serves the Black community with a focus on enhancing education accessibility. The Antelope Valley has over 2,000 foster youth, so services for transitioning out of the foster care system are crucial in this region.    

Households, especially those with children, struggle to cover costs of living amid high housing costs 

Antelope Valley households are more likely than all LA County households (across various demographics) to earn incomes below the real cost of living – a measure designed by United Ways of California to capture costs like housing, food, transportation, and child care that families need to cover. Half of households in and around Lancaster and Palmdale earn less than they need to cover this real cost of living, and four-in-five families with children under age six earn less than this real cost of living. 

 

>*"Historically, AV has been more affordable than other places in LA County...In the last 10 years, that has completely changed. Our housing is no longer affordable, especially for those on any type of services... It doesn’t surprise me that half of the households can’t afford the cost of living." *
>
>-Sarah Perry, Valley Oasis 

Without earnings covering a household’s basic needs, families will not be able to afford them. Take food for instance; Feeding America estimates that 55,110 children are food insecure in Congressional District 25, covering Antelope Valley outside of Lancaster.10 Over 10,000 Antelope Valley children under 5 participate in WIC to supplement their nutritional needs. Latinx children comprise the largest share of Antelope Valley WIC participants. Black children make up nearly 1 in 4 Lancaster WIC participants.[^11] 

High housing costs also make a household’s ability to cover its basic needs much more difficult. Nearly six in ten Antelope Valley renter households are burdened by housing costs greater than 30% of their incomes.[^12] 

 

Common life events such as losing a job, or an unexpected health issue can jeopardize a family’s ability to afford rent given such high costs. Though more recent data are not available, the Eviction Lab counted 636 evictions between 2013 and 2017.13 Homeowners struggle to keep up with payments considering the high housing costs as well. DataQuick counted 546 foreclosures between 2017 and June 2022.[^14] 

High housing costs can also lead to houselessness. Last year the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) counted 1,000 unhoused people in the cities of Lancaster and Palmdale. In addition, LAHSA counted thousands more unhoused people living just outside city boundaries in Antelope Valley (4,598 persons in total). This includes 3,570 unsheltered and 1,028 sheltered persons.15 A Vice News Report details how Antelope Valley law enforcement push unhoused persons out of city boundaries and into the broader, unincorporated areas where they are further disconnected from essential resources/services.16 In conversations with community members and Antelope Valley residents, almost every interviewee identified homelessness as a growing concern in the region. Organizations in the region are doing the best they can to support the individuals and families that are on the verge of homelessness but with the higher cost of living and inflation, their efforts are restricted. Donna Gaddis from the Children’s Center of the Antelope Valley shared, ”The money and resources we are able to provide clients is not going as far anymore because of how expensive the cost of living is now.” Furthermore, Sarah Perry from the Valley Oasis shared that, ”Our programs have the ability to house people who need it, but we need units to put them in and landlords that are flexible enough to work with the population we serve.”  

Now more than ever, it‘s imperative that LA County systems leaders spotlight the Antelope Valley, a region that many families originally moved to because other parts of the county were not affordable. Additionally, the initial low cost of living in the Antelope Valley over a decade ago offered a safe haven for some of LA County’s most vulnerable residents, such as domestic violence survivors and foster care parents. The alarming number of unhoused residents in the Antelope Valley is an indicator that the region is suffering from a lack of investment and attention.  

COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT: Valley Oasis started as a domestic violence shelter and today it’s an all-encompassing community-based organization serving the Antelope Valley region and providing all sorts of services for the families they see. For over 42 years, the organization has provided services to all different types of individuals for numerous services such as housing assistance, legal assistance, basic needs, a 24-hour hotline, transportation, counseling, and more. Even an organization with the capacity and foundation like Valley Oasis expressed struggling to continue providing the services they have been for over multiple years. The population in need is increasing and their ability to care for them is restricted by the lack of affordable housing or employment opportunities in the area or even transportation. Despite the restrictions, the organization has continued to provide services to the neediest and politically under-represented communities and advocate on their behalf.  

##Resource access is not keeping up with a growing and diverse population 

##Health 

"Antelope Valley stakeholders have been clear about the need for additional resources, including health and mental health services, early childhood education, and parks and recreation. The distribution of resources also varies based on location in the Antelope Valley, with service providers located mostly in the cities of Lancaster and Palmdale. Donna Gaddis also shared that, “We lost 20% of the mental health professionals in the AV workforce in the last two years...the shortage of health professionals is definitely impacting the quality of care as well." 

According to the Los Angeles County Health Survey, 16.4% of Antelope Valley children report difficulty accessing medical care (highest among county Service Planning Areas or SPAs). Medical care can be especially important for chronic conditions that need periodic medical care such as asthma. 18.8% of Antelope Valley children have been diagnosed with asthma at some point in their lives (highest among LA SPAs), meaning improving access to health care is especially important for the Antelope Valley population.  

 

 

The Antelope Valley has fewer health and medical professionals than other parts of the county and state. The area has a variety of medical and health professional shortage designations, including: 

- The Lake Los Angeles and Juniper Hills Little Rock Medical Services Study Areas (MSSAs) are Medically Underserved Areas17 

- These two MSSAs plus the Lancaster Central/Palmdale North Central and Palmdale Central MSSAs are Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas18 

These four MSSAs plus the Acton/Ravenna, Desert View Highlands/Lancaster West/Palmdale Northwest/Quartz Hill, and Elizabeth Lake/Gorman/Green Valley/Lake Hughes/Leona Valley/Neenach MSSAs are mental health professional shortage areas.19 This means that virtually the entire Antelope Valley is a mental health professional shortage area. 

The safety of children is threatened by the lack of health professionals in the area. Karla Garzon, a newer resident to the Antelope Valley region shared, "As a parent of small children, I worry about the availability of pediatric care in case of an emergency. There aren't many choices for emergency rooms in the Antelope Valley. Given the locations of some of the emergency rooms, I also worry about safety inside and outside of the facilities."  

The shortage of health professionals is impacting the quality of care and even more so for populations that already face disparities in healthcare such as Black women. Black babies in LA County are two to three times more likely to die before their first birthday than babies of other races. Kim Watson from Project Joy shared that, “People are going for medical treatment and they are not listening. I went to see them and told them my problems, and no one listened to me.” She notes that the inhumane history of medical professionals disregarding Black women’s pain has trickled down to the treatment herself and others experience today. Los Angeles County Africa American Infant and Maternal Mortality (AAIMM) helps lead the work in aiming to address this inequity (https://www.blackinfantsandfamilies.org/). AAIMM’s helps the Antelope Valley, for example, in bringing a Black maternity house to Lancaster, while also advocating for reforms countywide.  

More generally, pregnant women in the Antelope Valley face barriers to care during pregnancy. The LA County Department of Public Health reports that over 1,500 pregnant women in the Antelope Valley Service Planning Area lacked prenatal care in the first trimester (28.8% of live births). This is more than double the rate of county births without first trimester care (13.6% of live births).20 

Another resource that the current Antelope Valley infrastructure is not able to fully serve the population are parks and recreational centers. The Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation completed a Countywide Parks and Recreation Needs Assessment addition in 2022.21 The assessment has findings for the region in an Antelope Valley regional profile. Some key findings from that profile: 

The regional recreation facilities and trails in the area are poorly served by public transportation and largely inaccessible without the use of a personal vehicle. 

The highest Regional Recreation Need is found in Lake Los Angeles, Littlerock, and Sun Village due to a combination of social and environmental factors including population, access, and amenities.  

Community members identified heat, distance, safety, lack of information and limited facilities as barriers to park use for residents in the study area. 

Residents say they need more shade, cooling centers and access to water, affordable transit access to parks, additional facilities and programming, enhanced safety measures and more information about parks and amenities. 

One interviewee discussed the disparity in park and recreation quality between the eastside and westside of the Antelope Valley. Ruth Sanchez from Antelope Valley’s ACLU and DHF shared that, “The state of the child on the westside is very different from the eastside – latter vulnerable, patrolled a lot more, encounters with law enforcement bad, parks don’t have lights or hours, westside has heated pool, beautiful gym, skateboard ramps.” She further explained how this disparity in resources can lead to kids associated their self-worth to what they don’t have in comparison to their peers. The current lack of accessibility to safe and enjoyable spaces for youth is not setting them up to thrive.  

>COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT: NAMI ENDING THE SILENCE 
>
>National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI’s) Ending the Silence program is a series of workshops and presentations that focus on mental health and suicide awareness. It partners with several school districts and community centers throughout the Antelope Valley. It features speakers who have survived their own struggles with mental health, and spreads awareness of mental health. Since mental health access has to be formally accessed, it cannot conduct formal assessments. However, the awareness of mental health resources that it provides is a good way to cue students and community members about mental health issues and resources. In our interview with Jean, Antelope Valley Program Director for NAMI Urban Los Angeles, she talked about how much the pandemic has worsened mental health care access for youth. One of the reasons being that the need has increased, and the local supply has drained. Jean shared that telehealth has further incentivized mental health professional staff to relocate to urban centers, but telehealth is not accessible for everyone, especially for some in the Antelope Valley.  

>COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT: SYCAMORES  
>
>Sycamores is a “Whatever-it-takes" behavioral health and child welfare agency, with 10 locations of care across Los Angeles County. Sycamores in Palmdale offers mental health services for children, families, and young adults, and operates a Family Resource Center that provides free services such as a food bank, rental assistance program, free after school tutoring program, a family friendly location for DCFS Social Workers to host monitored visits for children and their parents. Numerous parents and advocates of the Antelope Valley region expressed a greater need for accessible programming for youth outside of school and Sycamores helps fill that need. The Afterschool Learning Lab program pairs middle school and high school youth with a teacher to assist them with their homework. In addition, a certified guidance counselor is available to meet with parents and students to assist in providing education and support with the college and financial aid application process. Serving many first-generation prospective college students, Sycamores is dedicated to helping parents who may not have been able to attend college to support their child in meeting their academic goals. Chad Scott, Assistant Vice President for Sycamores in SA 1, shared that since the pandemic, the number of referrals to Sycamores has been unprecedented. In an attempt to increase access to care for new clients, Sycamores is recruiting new therapists and social workers and has begun offering group services and community workshops/training/programming. Due to a nationwide workforce shortage of mental health professionals, particularly in the Antelope Valley, Scott and his team have found it challenging to recruit the number of professionals to meet the demand for mental health services in the Antelope Valley. However, he remains hopeful that the Antelope Valley, as a whole, can work together to meet the needs of our community. 

##Child Welfare 

The LA County Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS) reports higher rates of substantiated referrals – or reports of child abuse or neglect where authorities identify reasonable cause to believe maltreatment occurred – in the Antelope Valley than in other parts of the county. The average referral rate among Antelope Valley statistical areas is nearly twice the county average (12.2 substantiated referrals per 1,000 children in the Antelope Valley vs. 6.4 per 1,000 in LA County).22  

 

On the other hand, the Antelope Valley is also a cold spot in the county for services supporting children and families in the child welfare system. Some families experience intimate partner abuse or other forms of domestic violence at the same time child abuse or neglect is occurring. The Antelope Valley has half as many domestic violence services per capita than the rest of the county.23 Four organizations are listed as offering domestic violence services in the Antelope Valley (High Road Program - Lancaster, Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County - Antelope Valley Domestic Abuse Self Help, Antelope Valley Domestic Violence Council - Unhoused Solutions Access Center, and The Children’s Center of the Antelope Valley). Sarah from Valley Oasis highlights how different issues such as economic instability and a lack of mental health resources overload the system.  

“AV has some of the highest amounts of foster youth, a lot of them are dealing with unstable family situations or living with families that aren’t their biological parents... There’s a lot of need for counseling services. Family separation is also an issue we see a lot in our programs, either because of financial issues because caregivers cannot afford to take care of their kids or violence at home. And a lot of youth that come out of foster care don’t have anywhere to go.” -Sarah Perry, Valley Oasis 

All foster children are required to have a mental health screening,24 but Antelope Valley (SPA 1) parents are most likely to report difficulties accessing medical care for their children among SPAs. Antelope Valley parents reported medical care access difficulties for 16.4% of Antelope Valley children, whereas LA County parents overall reported difficulties for 9.3% of children25￼  

"If we were in any other part of Los Angeles County, there would be a lot more options and choices, maybe not enough but more options." -Jean Harris, National Alliance for Mental Illness  

On a positive note, there are local services aimed at children and families in the Antelope Valley, including the Black Infant Health Program of Antelope Valley, the Children’s Bureau Sunrise Center, and others who work to ensure families have what they need to access care. 

COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT: CHILDREN’S CENTER ANTELOPE VALLEY 

The Children’s Center of the Antelope Valley is a non-profit organization focused on improving the holistic health and well-being of children and families in Northern Los Angeles County. CCAV provides wraparound services which includes temporary housing vouchers for domestic violence survivors, therapy and counseling for foster care youth, training for increasing professionals/paraprofessionals in the region, and much more. Donna Gaddis, Executive Director of the CCAV and a resident of the region for over 30 years shared the increase in demand for their services and a decrease in purchasing power due to the higher cost of living. 

Early childhood education 

Due to the lack of child care seats, no Antelope Valley ZIP Code has sufficient access to child care. Over 93% of infants and toddlers eligible for subsidized child care were not enrolled in a publicly subsidized early learning and care program in 2020.26 Preschool accessibility was hardly better: over 64% of preschoolers eligible for subsidized child care were not enrolled in a publicly subsidized early learning and care program.27 These high rates of low-income children without publicly subsidized early care and education mean it is difficult for parents to find affordable care for their children. Survey results bear this out: 40.9% of Antelope Valley's parents report difficulty finding child care (highest among county SPAs).28 To care for their children, oftentimes parents have to make the difficult choice between  working less or leaving the work force. Other parents may work more or sacrifice other basic needs to afford higher-cost child care. Some parents may pay for a lower quality of care or may rely on family, friends, or neighbors to provide child care which may or may not be the best option for families. Measures to increase the supply of child care and reduce the cost to Antelope Valley families are desperately needed. 

 

Equitable treatment of Antelope Valley residents is a concern 

Residents and advocates spoke of a diverse community that comes together in ways that more segregated portions of LA County do not yet challenges persist.  The rate of hate crimes in the Antelope Valley is actually higher than the rate in the county as a whole, with higher rates of hate crimes targeting racial-ethnic groups.29 

Antelope Valley law enforcement unfairly targets Black residents as well, injuring Black residents at higher rates than residents as a whole.30 While Antelope Valley-specific statistics are unavailable, the LA County Sheriff’s Department as a whole stops Black and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) populations in traffic stops at significantly higher rates than people of other racial-ethnic groups. For example, Sheriff’s deputies stop Black drivers at rates 2.4 times higher than White drivers and NHPI drivers at rates 2.5 times higher than White drivers.31 Court monitors find that efforts to reform LA County Sheriff’s Department practices resulting in unreasonable force, intimidation, and unlawful stops and searches among Black and Latino residents are slow or not happening.32 

These Antelope Valley parents are part of the larger adult population that reports highest-among-SPA rates of discrimination when seeking health care. 6.7% of Antelope Valley adults rated their experience as worse compared to people of other races when seeking health care in 2018, compared to 3.8% of county adults overall.33 

 

Residents and advocates say that teachers and staff that care about students and are representative of them is important for school success. Unfortunately, teacher and staff diversity has not kept pace with a diversifying student body. Most Antelope Valley school district students are Latinx but see relatively few Latinx teachers and staff. White students made up 13.4% of enrolled students in 2018 and White teachers and staff made up 69.4% of all teachers and staff. By contrast Latinx students made up 63.2% of enrolled students and Latinx teachers and staff made up 17.9% of all teachers and staff. Without representative teachers and staff, residents and advocates worry about the equitable treatment of their children. 

 

 

A schoolhouse to jailhouse pipeline hinders schools with lower student outcomes 

An education system with low student outcomes and punitive processes that push students out of schools can contribute to a schoolhouse to jailhouse pipeline. Student outcomes in Antelope Valley schools are lower than those of the county as a whole. Foster students and students with disabilities – students who might need the most support – are most likely to be suspended. 

>*"Educational system and school districts up here can be challenging. A lot of the schools are understaffed and underfunded. Classroom sizes are high and test scores are low."*  
>
>-Chad Scott, Sycamores 

Antelope Valley residents and advocates interviewed were critical of the state of Antelope Valley schools. Antelope Valley student outcomes are lower than those of the county: Antelope Valley schools graduate 67% of their eligible students compared to the county rate of 86.1%.34 

These outcomes vary by racial-ethnic group. Antelope Valley schools graduate Latinx (63.6%) and Black students (64.8%) at the lowest rates while graduating Filipino (82.7%) and Asian (80.7%) students at the highest rates.  

 

 

 

Residents and advocates highlight many student populations that need tailored support but face a punitive education system. Unfortunately, Antelope Valley schools suspend many of these student populations at high rates. Antelope Valley schools suspended foster students and Black students at twice the rate of students overall and suspended students with disabilities, AIAN, and NHPI students at higher rates than students overall as well.35 Overall, Antelope Valley schools suspend students at a higher rate (4.7% of students) than LA County (1.7%) and the State (3.2%).36 

 

 

 

One interviewee said her son was placed in an ESL course even though he didn’t speak Spanish solely based on his last name. Disparate rates of chronic absenteeism might also hint at how welcome and integrated different groups of students feel in Antelope Valley schools. Black students are chronically absent at nearly triple the rate of Asian and Filipino students.37 

COMMUNITY SPOTLIGHT: Project Joy is a community-founded nonprofit organization that aims to provide the support for many families, children and youth in the Antelope Valley region who need to live a full life with stability. The Youth Program run by Project Joy provides an after-school tutoring program, a youth sports camp, and an AI learning program. In addition, the organization provides basic needs, family resiliency services and community empowerment resources. Project Joy provides safe and nourishing spaces for youth in the Antelope Valley region to set themselves up for success.   

#Solutions 

It is clear from the data and what residents tell us that the state of the child in Antelope Valley requires a more proactive whole-child focused system of support. This infrastructure would interrupt the schoolhouse-to-jailhouse and foster-youth to unhoused-youth pipelines. It would return high academic achievement in schools and bring more resources to children and families in the Antelope Valley. Specifically, it would include enough health and mental services for Antelope Valley residents to be seen by Antelope Valley doctors in a timely and culturally competent manner. Steps to get there include:  

Address basic needs. This report finds increases in WIC participation, foreclosures, the unhoused population, and more examples of people needing support for their basic needs. Raising wages and strengthening the safety net are a top priority.  

Holding systems accountable. This includes holding leaders who punish the unhoused rather than addressing the root causes to account; demanding transparency in local budgets to see that monies appropriated for the unhoused house them; and creating pathways for a diverse group of leaders who reflect the communities they govern.  

Increasing the State child care subsidy reimbursement rates for early educators/child care providers. Because child care providers often earn poverty wages, the state faces a dire child care workforce shortage. Increasing their wages will retain and recruit more workers into the field. Increasing access for families, can provide them with more opportunities to work and earn incomes that meet their needs, and have additional time with their children. More child care providers in the field will offer more and more affordable child care options for Antelope Valley families. 

Increasing investments in health and mental health services. An area of over 400,000 people should not be subjected to such service shortages. Increases should come both from within current budgets and new revenues. For example, advocates can find funds that currently go to law enforcement for mental health and housing and redirect them to mental health and housing departments. Advocates can also raise funds for community schools with wraparound health services or other services communities need.  

Increasing investments in learning resources for children and families. One of the most repeated worries among Antelope Valley parents we spoke to was the lack of extracurricular learning activities for their children. Investments in afterschool programs, parks and recreation, libraries, and other programs are a critical need. Residents also spoke to the need for parenting and educational resources. 

Sharing more resources among organizations and individuals. Despite lower rates of resources than other parts of the county, the Antelope Valley still has many resources that are unknown because of distance, language, internet, or other access barriers. Sharing resources like [THIS DMH SPA 1 RESOURCE GUIDE] helps connect people who need them. 

Cross-sector collaboration. Too often the state of children, especially the state of young children (aged 0 to 5) is not connected to larger systems at work. For example, child care isn’t thought of as connected to the workforce or the unhoused population isn’t thought of as connected to the foster youth system. Residents of the Antelope Valley tell us that these are connected, and that it will take collaborations of early child advocates, and workforce advocates, foster youth advocates, and housing advocates to build the infrastructure needed for children and families. 

Continued advocacy for more resources for children and families. The Children’s Bureau facilitates a network of organizational and individual advocates. Growing that network [by contacting X] is a step that anyone reading this report can take. 

Develop new advocates. Residents tell us that many parents don’t know their rights in interactions with law enforcement or school administrators. A number of advocacy organizations train residents and build community power, while supporting them. 

When asked, what would you like to see policymakers and systems leaders do? 

I wish our local government looked at the unhoused population with compassion and not as a burden because these are people who need help. 

We need to advocate for people in education settings to go into the mental health field and provide a way for them to be able to afford to do that. 

In a perfect world, a ton of mental health providers…While there is a counselor at each site and a social worker per site, its not enough. We need more on-the-ground service providers whether its attendance, or social workers, or more counselors, supporting mental health resources. 

We have to address the whole person. If we don’t take care of our kids, they are the first priority and they rely on us as a village.   

For enrichment activities, it really comes down to funding, there are a lot of orgs out here that can do enrichment and that means infrastructure as well but they do not have the funding. 

The excellence isn’t at the poorer high schools any more – how do we raise them up again. 

Cut the red tape, we have empty buildings that belong to the city, and a lot of city land, why do we keep giving breaks to big corporations to build. City officials campaign a lot on unhoused and foster youth, but nothing gets done. 

They [law enforcement] need to be able to see children as children. As black people we feel that law enforcement forgets that our kids are kids. 

Prisons are managed at the state level: wanting to see more interventions there to disrupt the cycles of families getting cycled through the prison system. 

Giving different ways for the community to express their needs goes a long way. 

True affordable housing, rehabilitation, true mental health resources, we have people with mental issues, we need to treat them how they need to be treated. 

Talk to the children and families instead of telling them what you are going to do. Listen to what they are saying and what people on the ground who are doing the work are saying.  

Stay accountable to the Antelope Valley once they’re in office. 

An all encompassing resource hub for unhoused populations that live in vehicles. 

 

#Conclusions/Recommendations 

In speaking with residents and reviewing data, this report finds many positives, but also many challenges for Antelope Valley children. The lack of resources, especially health, mental health, and extracurricular resources for children, weighs heavily on families. With a growing population, a failure to invest in more resources will mean ever fewer resources available over time. We recommend a more proactive and robust approach to infrastructure for children and families in this context. 

But beyond access, equity needs to be addressed. Students need to see more teachers and school staff with similar backgrounds, residents need to see more leaders they know share their concerns. One resident spoke to how seeing someone like him ‘make it’ to where he wanted to go changed the trajectory of his young life. The Antelope Valley needs that trajectory for all its children. 

And this work poses some larger questions. For decades families from elsewhere in the County have moved to the Antelope Valley, enticed by the low cost of living and family-friendly atmosphere. Residents and data tell us that that affordability is vanishing. What does it mean for the county that the Antelope Valley is losing that low cost of living and family-friendly atmosphere? What does that mean for LA County that one of the last affordable places for working families is no longer so affordable? 

The Children’s Bureau and the Best Start network in the Antelope Valley are an important locus of change in the Antelope Valley and are great places to continue the conversation for answers. 

When asked, how would you define the State of the Child? 

The State of the Child is in a state of emergency. There is an emergency need for resources, therapy, accessibility, and accountability. 

I think there’s a lot of people who care out here and a lot of people doing good work. I think the State of the Child in the AV is hopeful because there’s a lot of agencies out here doing the best work to improve the quality of life for people. 

I don’t think the state of the child is where it should be. It needs some solutions and some healing… There is an African saying, they greet each other and say “how are the children” the response that you want is “all of the children are well”  and when I think about the children in the AV I feel like I can’t say that. 

The state of the child is poor... A lack of resources , a lack of healthcare, a lack of jobs, poverty. I am deeply concerned about the state of our children.. 

I want to believe that we can make change, but I hope that we can do it fast enough because I’m concerned that we are going to lose this whole generation. I just want kids to be kids. I want them to be burden –free and joyful, secure in their homes and their families. 

The State of the Child in the AV is not good… poverty is rising, accessibility to educational opportunities are lacking…More and more women with children are homeless – how are we wrapping our hands around them. 

The state of the child in the AV is guardedly optimistic. I feel like the community here are invested. If we come up with solutions, it has to be structured and built out of this community. 

We are at a disadvantage. In the AV, my biggest worry is that we don’t have enough information accessible to help our kids succeed and communities are left to figure that on their own in a very competitive world. 

The state of the child on the westside is very different from the eastside.
